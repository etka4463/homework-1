  <h1>Kalra, Etash</h1>
  <p> Some fun facts about me:
    <ul>
      <li>I am on a Bhangra-Fusion Dance team at CU Boulder!</li>
      <li>I have bungie jumped from 20 stories before.</li>
      <li>I have never broken a bone (I drank a lot of milk as a kid).</li>
    </ul>
    I am studying computer science at CU Boulder because I have been very interested in programming for a while now.
    I started learning to code in eigth grade, and since then, I have taken many computer science classes,
    created several apps, and I hope to dive even deeper into the subject in college.
